## Objectives 

In this instructional article, I will thoroughly explain how to prep cornish hen houses for Tyson Foods. The article will consist of a step by step proccess illustrating the important tasks that must be performed in order to recieve baby chickens from Tysons. This article is designed for people who are interested in learning how commercial poultry operations operate or for people who intend to get into the business and want to learn the different aspects of prepping the poultry houses for cornish hens. This article also assumes that the reader has some basic knowledge of the poultry industry.

## Introduction to raising cornish hens

Cornish hens are chickens that are 24-26 days old and are primarily raised for human consumption. These chickens are usually sold whole in the food store for the consumers to purchase and weigh roughly 1.50-2.00 lbs. On average, eight billion chickens are consumed each year worldwide, which demonstrates the high demand for chicken. Understanding how to prepare the houses for baby chickens plays an important role in the overall growing process. The steps will be in chronological order, starting with the first task after the cornish hens are sold to Tyson Foods and ending with the final task before receiving baby cornish hens from Tyson. In order to perform the tasks at hand, there is a variety of tools and equipment needed.

The equipment needed consists of:

- Tractor with front end loader, rear blade attachment, and priefert litter saver attachment
- Atv with dump bed
- General tools and equipment (wrenches, hammers, drills, etc.)
- Food trays (found at poultry surplus stores)
- Rolls of paper (supplied by Tysons)
- Feed scoops, buckets, petition boards, propane torch
- Power washer with 330 gallon cube tank to hold water
- Other necessary equipment that might need to be replaced at the end of each batch (fan belts, feedline motors, etc.
- Radio to help pass time (optional)

## How to prepare cornish hen houses for Tyson Foods

**Step One:** Within 24 hours of selling the cornish hens, the litter must be rolled into three windrows by using the tractor and the rear blade attachment. Before windrowing the litter, it is important to clean out the four corners of the poultry house by using the front end loader. This is because the rear blade simply can't clean out the corners. By windrowing the litter, all of the diseases and bacteria that may have developed from the previous batch of chickens will be killed from the internal heat, which ensures a healthy litter bed for the new batch of chickens. After four to five days, the windrows must be turned in order to kill any bacteria that may remain on the surface of the rows.

**Step Two:** After eight days, the litter needs to be aeriated with the Priefert litter saver attachment to mulch up any large clumps of litter and create a more disired bedding substrate. After each windrow is slowly aeriated, the floors need to be leveled out evenly by using the rear blade attachment. After leveling out the bedding material, you are now ready for the next step.

**Step Three:** Once all of the bedding material is leveled out, you can start lowering all of the equipment in the houses (stoves, forced air heaters, feed/water lines, etc.) After the equipment is lowered, all of the stoves and fans need to be washed by using the power washer and the 330 gallon cube. It is important to powerwash this equipment because throughout each batch of chickens, dust accumulates which can cause equipment to malfunction. Once all of the equipment is eradicated of all of the accumulated dust, you are ready for the next step.

**Step Four:** Finish lowering all of the equipment and put up the three petitions in the designated areas throughout the house to prevent the birds from migrating throughout the entire house. Tysons will let you know when it is time to take down a petition and allow the birds to migrate further in the house. 

**Step Five:** Once the petitions are up, it is time to start placing the trays down around the feedlines and  place the correct amount around each brooder stove (Tyson will supply you with the info regarding the quantity of trays around each stove). Once the trays are correctly distributed throughout the house, you are ready to start feeding. First, start by running feed throughout each feedline which will fill the trays under the each line. The trays around the brooder stoves will have to be manually filled up. For this task, you will use the ATV and pour feed into the dump bed out of the down spout that connects to the feed hopper (you may have to repeat this step until the task is completed). Once the ATV is filled up, you are ready to fill each tray around the stoves. Using the feed scoops, you will place one scoop per tray until all of the trays are filled. 

**Step Six:** After all of the feeding is completed, it is time to unroll the rolls of paper supplied by Tysons under each waterline so the baby chickens will be able to find the water quickly. For this task, one person will hold the roll of paper and the other person will walk under each water line and place the paper down. It is crucial that you make sure the paper is centered under the waterline, or else you are just wasting your time.

**Step Seven:** Once the paper is under the waterlines, it is time to perform some general maintenance on different pieces of equipment that may have broke or is out dated in the chicken houses. This step will vary depending on each batch. Some common maintenance operations include changing light bulbs, replacing worn out fan belts, fixing leaking waterlines, etc. After this step is completed, it is time for the final step in the preparation process.

**Step Eight:** This step must always be performed last because you don't want to waste money on unneccessary propane. For this step, you will use the propane torch to manually light each brooder stove in the first petition. After all of the stoves are lit, all you have to do is heat the house up to around ninety degrees. This step needs to be completed one day prior to you recieving the baby cornish hens to provide an adequate amount of time for the houses to reach the disired temperature.
